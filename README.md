# Appointment Management

An app that mimics basic functionality of creating appointments with customers built with Angular version 16.0.2. This app builds off of the server created with the [Basic CRM](https://github.com/stevengvan/basic-crm) and adds new api routes to create, edit, and delete appointments. That also means newly created customers on the Basic CRM can be used to create appointments as well. The main purpose of this project was primarily meant to learn and explore Angular's tools.

## Demo

The app is deployed on Netlify and is found [here](https://appt-management.netlify.app). Please do not add actual information to the application as this project was only made for learning purposes.

To create new customers to add to an appointment, click [here](https://stevengvan-basic-crm.netlify.app) to go to the CRM.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can upload the `dist/` folder to deploy the app.
